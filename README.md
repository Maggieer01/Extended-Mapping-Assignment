MA615 Extended Mapping Assignment. 

This assignment includes a document, a presentation using revealjs, and a Shinyapp.

*******************************************************************************************
1.Necessary Data tables are too large to push on Github (cTable and PublicAssistanceFundedProjectsDetails)
  I put them in the Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dJMWGI7LGiREahB4IJeUzxoEOGNWbhok?usp=sharing

2.Shinyapp that published on shinyapps.io only uses 30000 rows of data because the original data is too large to publish on it, see https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/application/3207926
 
 Again, the original data cTable is in the Google Drive, you can download it and run the app.R.
